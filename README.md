#### What I love the most is learning. Learning how things work, learning how to be more efficient, learning what's possible!<br>All through coding.<br>Below are the projects I’m most proud of and that best represent me as a programmer:

### 👀 [Upcoming Full Stack Project]():
Stay tuned for more!

### 😊 [Smile](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/smile), an open-source, modular C library for 2D game development:
Smile is a cross-platform (Mac and Windows) library that streamlines common game development tasks such as managing scenes, simulating particles, and saving/loading. Ideal for game jams and rapid prototyping.

### 🤖 [Sumobots](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/sumobot), i.e., Sumo-Fighting Robots:
Arduino-based robots that won me two competitions while I was in university. It was funny seeing people wonder how a Cinema student was able to win 2 competitions in a row. They didn't know about my Engineering background...
