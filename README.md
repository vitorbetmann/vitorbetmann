<p>
  With a backgrounds in engineering and cinema, I blend creative vision with technical precision to build tools, systems, and games.
</p>
<p>
  My main interest is abstracting complicated/repetitive processes by making tools and systems for others, but I also love understanting how things work under the hood, so you'll see me dabbing into low-level programming from time to time.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re looking for someone who bridges the creative and the technical, I’d love to connect. Get in touch!

- 🚀 Currenlty working on 2 major projects:
  - A full stack project... More in the next few days.
  - [Smile](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/smile), an open-source, modular C library for 2D game development.
- 📚 Currently learning `django`, `React`, `PostgreSQL`, `Docker`, `GitHub Actions`, and `Selenium`.
- 🤖 It was always funny seeing other students wonder how a Cinema major won [two robotics competitions](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/Robot_Sumo)... They didn't know about my Engineering background.
- 🎯 2026 Goal: Develop a mobile app or game.
