<p>
  With a backgrounds in engineering and cinema, I blend creative vision with technical precision to build tools, systems, and games.
</p>
<p>
  My main interest is abstracting complicated/repetitive processes by making tools and systems for others, but I also love understanting how things work under the hood, so you'll see me dabbing into low-level programming from time to time.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re looking for someone who bridges the creative and the technical, I’d love to connect. Get in touch!

- 💡 What I'm Building:
  - A full stack project... More in a bit.
  - [Smile](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/smile), an open-source, modular C library for 2D game development.
- 📚 What I'm Learning: `django`, `React`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Selenium`.
- 😍 Likes: Computer Graphics, Coffee Shops, Winter, Resident Evil
- 😡 Dislikes: Summer
- 🤣 Trivia about me: While in university, most people didn't know I had a background in Mechanical Engineering, so it was always funny seeing them wonder how a Cinema student managed to win [2 robotics competitions](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/Robot_Sumo).
